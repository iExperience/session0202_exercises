  <h1>Hi! My name is Richard Lin</h1>
  <h2>I am currently a Computer Science major at Wayne State University</h3>
  <p>WSU is located in the center of Midtown Detroit</p>
  <p>I was born on February 4th, 1993 in Detroit.</p>
  <p>I wanted to learn how to code because I disliked marketing.(Very random I know)</p>
  <p>What I'm really looking forward to do while I'm in South Africa is shark cage diving</p>
