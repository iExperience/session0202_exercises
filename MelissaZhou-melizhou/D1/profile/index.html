    <h3>Why code?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I am addicted to the internet/technology, so I should probably learn how it works. Also, I want to learn a new skill in a field I've never explored, which will hopefully shape my future aspirations. </p>

    <h3>What's in Cape Town?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm excited for hiking, surfing, essentially anything outdoors as well as for the local food of course and learning about the culture.I'm scared of heights, but I know the views will be worth it. </p>

    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I'm terrible on two-wheeled vehicles. The only bone I've broken was in my finger when I fell off a razor scooter at the age of 6. When I was 14, I gained many scars from learning to ride a bike, at which I'm still awful. At age 17, I went to Germany, where I crashed a moped.</div>
