  <h1><span>More About Me<L/span></h1>
  <p style="background: black;">I am a 21 year old music festival fanatic from Houston, TX (see the pug tank top above)<br> and I'm more seriously interested in several other areas (I'll list a few):</P>
  <ul style="background: black;">
    <li>Baseball (I play in college!).</li>
    <li>Any Natural Science (I study Chemical and Biological Engineering).</li>
    <li>Many social sciences (Admittedly, I know far less about these).</li>
    <li>Breakfast - it is by far the best meal of the day in my opinion.</li>
    <li>Medicine - I especially love companies that innovate in the market for prosthetics and other medical devices.</li>
    <li>Snowboarding, fishing, and smiling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><span>[and the list goes on...]</span></p>

  <p><span>Why am I stoked to learn how to code in Cape Town?</span></p>
  <p style="background: black;"> Because learning to code boldy faces the unknown and makes the statement that "Anything is possible."<br> What's more is that in Cape Town I know the people at iXperience will be right there with me to inspire, support and bring the process to life. PS I can't wait to go sandboarding in South Africa!</p>
