   20

2. (1) Equates loudness to 20, (2) puts "IT'S SO LOUD", (3) puts the last line loudness as 20 because loudenss=20 in line 1.

3. When the method get_louder is called upon, loudness=20 from INSIDE the method BUT immediately after, loudness=10 from OUTSIDE the method because the method has ended.
