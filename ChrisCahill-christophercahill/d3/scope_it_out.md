1. It returns 20. 
2. The get_louder method defines a local variable (loudness) as equal to 20. It then puts "IT'S SO LOUD" then it returns the local variable loudness (which is 20, NOT 10). 
3. The value of loudness is 10 because the loudness variable inside the method is unrelated to the loudness variable inside.
