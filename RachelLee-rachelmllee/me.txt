Hi! I'm Rachel. I was born and raised in Hong Kong with my twin brother Robert, who's 1 minute younger than me (hah!). My mom says that when we were babies, she separated us to sleep on different mattresses on the floor, and the first one to wake up would crawl to the other one's mattress to cuddle. Yeah we're pretty cute :)
