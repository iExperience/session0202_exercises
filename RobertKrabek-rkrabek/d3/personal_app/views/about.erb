           <p>Hi!
            I'm Robert, a recent graduate from Harvard majoring in neurobiology and minoring in CS. Other interests include lifting, ballroom dance, basketball, travelling, music, and raging. I also now spend a fair amount of time pondering what I will do with my life because I don't have a real job.. so you'll probably find me at the bar.</p>

            <p>I grew up in Beijing for the first 18 years of my life going to international school there before graduating and taking a gap year in Montreal to learn French. I entered Harvard class of 2014 but took a year off mid college to rehabilitate from a torn ACL and to do thesis reserach. Towards the end of junior year I decided I was sick of killing mice, sick of pre-med, and wanted to pursue a career in computer science so I began working towards that at the beginning of my senior year. Now I'm recently graduated and living the dream in Cape Town, South Africa. Next year I will be returning to Harvard to be a teaching fellow for CS50; their introductory computer science class while looking for a real job and training to compete in the 2017 World Dance Championships in Blackpool, England.
