<div>
<p>why code?<br /><small>I am interested in coding both because it's fun and also because I believe that tech has the ability to bring individuals, skills, and knowlege from various diciplines together to create something completely new.</small></p>

<div>
<p>why South Africa?<br /><small>I can't begin describe how pumped I am to be in Cape Town. I have heard NOTHING but good (great) things about the city and it's freakin' gorgeous! I've been frantically looking up pictures and can't wait to see the city in the flesh. From exploring the city to shopping to eating to nightlife, Cape Town is one of the things that makes this trip to South Africa so exciting for me.</small></p>

<div>
<p>something about me?<br /><small>Beyond coding I like to ballroom dance ... all the time. I also used to play the trumpet fairly seriously (not so much anymore unfortunately) and love jazz music!</small></p>
