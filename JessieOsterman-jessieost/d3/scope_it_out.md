###Jessie E2 Scope it out

1. 20
2. Step 1: it assigns the variable `loudness` the integer of `20`
   Step 2: it prints the string `"IT'S SO LOUD"` to the console
   Step 3: it returns the variable `loudness` which is the integer `20`
3. the value of `loudness` is `10` because it is assigned that value at the beginning of the program outside of the method.
