	  <h2>Why do I want to learn how to code?</h2>
	  <p>Computers are becoming more and more central to our lives. Since coding is the language of computers, it is also the key to taking control over our lives and the future.</br>
	  <p>I took an introduction to Java class at Brown, but it consumed way too much of my life. I did not have enough time to practice what I was learning in class and couldn't develop the skill in-depth. That is why I'm looking forward to focusing on this over the summer!</p>

	  <p>As someone who has just started learning about design and innovation, I hope to learn about why Cape Town was designated as the World Design Capital of last year.</p>
