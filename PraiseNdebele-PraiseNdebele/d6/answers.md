- A given verb tells the http the kind of request made and looks for a controller which says how it must be done. This controller then directs to the views which does what was requested.

- A schema describes the structure of exactly how the data is store in a database which itself if a collection of information that is organised so that it can easily be accessed , managed , and updated. A model is an abstract representation of database (table)

- Data migration makes it possible to transfer data between storage types, formats, or computer systems.
