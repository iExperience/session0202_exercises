#Day 3, excericse 3A
###Josh Broomberg, session 2

1. It returns 20.
2. Question 2
  1. declares loudness local variable with value 20
  2. Outputs "IT'S SO LOUD" to console
  3. implcitly returns var `loudness` ie returns value 20
3. The fact that a variable called loudness is given the value 20 inside get_lounder has no impact on the value of the original loudness. The second variable is local to the method (scope = local) thus its value has no impact on the value of the original.
