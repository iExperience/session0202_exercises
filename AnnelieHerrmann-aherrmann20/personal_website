  <h2>Student at i_Xperience tech academy</h2>
  <p>Hi! I'm Annelie, a sophomore at Harvard originally from the mitten state, Michigan.
  <br>
  I'm excited to learn to code because I believe it's a necessary skill to have in this day and age, and it seems like a blast!
  <br>
  In Cape Town (besides meeting all of you!), I'm most looking forward to hiking Table Mountain. I'd love some hiking buddies!
  <br>
  Fun Fact: Due to a childhood skiing accident, my left leg is 2 cm shorter than my right!
